Let's start at the very beginning, \\
a very nice place to start, \\
when you sing, you begin with A, B, C, \\
when you simulate, you begin with the topology,\footnote{%

This document (\emph{ns Notes and Documentation}) provides reference
  documentation for ns.
Although we begin with a simple simulation script,
  resources like Marc Greis's tutorial web pages
  (originally at his web site,
  now at \url{http://www.isi.edu/nsnam/ns/tutorial/})
  or the slides from one of the ns tutorials
  are problably better places to begin for the ns novice.

We first begin by showing a simple simulation script.
This script is also available in the sources in
\textasciitilde\emph{ns}/{tcl/ex/simple.tcl}.

This script defines a simple topology of four nodes,
and two agents, a UDP agent with a CBR traffic generator, and a TCP agent.
The simulation runs for $3s$.  The output is two trace files,
{\tt out.tr} and {\tt out.nam}.
When the simulation completes at the end of $3s$,
it will attempt to run a nam visualisation of the simulation on your
screen.

\begin{verbatim}
# The preamble
set ns [new Simulator]			# initialise the simulation;

# Predefine tracing
set f [open out.tr w]
\$ns trace-all \$f
set nf [open out.nam w]
\$ns namtrace-all \$nf
