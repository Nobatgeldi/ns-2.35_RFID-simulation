\chapter{Links: Simple Links}
\label{chap:links}

This is the second aspect of defining the topology.
In \href{the previous chapter}{Chapter}{chap:nodes},
we had described how to create the nodes in the topology in \emph{ns}.
We now describe how to create the links to connect the nodes and complete
the topology.
In this chapter, we restrict ourselves to describing the simple
point to point links.
\emph{ns}\ supports a variety of other media, including
an emulation of a multi-access LAN using a mesh of simple links,
and other true simulation of wireless and broadcast media.
They will be described in a separate chapter.
The CBQlink is derived from simple links and is a considerably more
complex form of link that is also not described in this chapter.

We begin by describing the commands to create a link in this section.
As with the node being composed of classifiers, 
a simple link is built up from a sequence of connectors.
We also briefly describe some of the connectors in a simple link.
We then describe
\href{the instance procedures that operate on the various components of
defined by some of these connectors}{Section}{sec:links:components}.
We conclude the chapter
\href{with a description the connector object}{Section}{sec:links:connectors},
including brief
descriptions of the common link connectors.

The \clsref{Link}{../ns-2/ns-link.tcl}
is a standalone class in OTcl,
that provides a few simple primitives.
The \clsref{SimpleLink}{../ns-2/ns-link.tcl}
provides the ability to connect two nodes with a point to point link.
\emph{ns}\ provides the instance procedure
\fcnref{\proc[]{simplex-link}}{../ns-2/ns-link.tcl}{Simulator::simplex-link}
to form a unidirectional link from one node to another.
The link is in the class SimpleLink.
The following describes the syntax of the simplex link:
\begin{verbatim}
    set ns [new Simulator]
    \$ns simplex-link \tup{node0} \tup{node1} \tup{bandwidth} \tup{delay} \tup{queue\_type}
\end{verbatim}
The command creates a link from {\tt \tup{node0}} to {\tt \tup{node1}},
with specified {\tt \tup{bandwidth}} and {\tt \tup{delay}} characteristics.
The link uses a queue of type {\tt \tup{queue\_type}}.
The procedure also adds a TTL checker to the link.
Five instance variables define the link:

\centerline{\begin{tabular}{rp{4in}}
	{\tt head\\_} &	Entry point to the link, it points
			to the first object in the link. \\
	{\tt queue\\_} & Reference to the main queue element of the link.
			Simple links usually have one queue per link.
			Other more complex types of links may have multiple
			queue elements in the link. \\
	{\tt link\\_} &	A reference to the element
			that actually models the link,
			in terms of the delay and bandwidth characteristics
			of the link. \\
	{\tt ttl\\_} &	Reference to the element that manipulates the
			ttl in every packet. \\
	{\tt drophead\\_} & Reference to an object that is the head of a
			queue of elements that process link drops. \\
	    \end{tabular}}

In addition, if the simulator instance variable, 
{\tt \$traceAllFile\_}, is defined, 
the procedure will add trace elements that track when a packet is
enqueued and dequeued from {\tt queue\_}.
Furthermore, tracing interposes a drop trace element after the
{\tt drophead\_}.
\begin{figure}[tb]
  \centerline{\includegraphics{link}}
  \caption{Composite Construction of a Unidirectional Link}
  \label{fig:link}
\end{figure}
The following instance variables track the trace elements:

\centerline{\begin{tabular}{rp{4in}}
	{\tt enqT\\_} &	Reference to the element that traces
			packets entering {\tt queue\\_}.\\
	{\tt deqT\\_} &	Reference to the element that traces
			packets leaving {\tt queue\\_}.\\
	{\tt drpT\\_} &	Reference to the element that traces
			packets dropped from {\tt queue\\_}.\\
	{\tt rcvT\\_} &	Reference to the element that traces
			packets received by the next node.\\
	    \end{tabular}}

Note however, that if the user enable tracing multiple times on the link,
these instance variables will only store a reference to the
last elements inserted.

Other configuration mechanisms that add components to a simple link
are network interfaces (used in multicast routing), 
link dynamics models, and tracing and monitors.
We give 
\href{a brief overview of the related objects at the end of this chapter}{%
		Section}{sec:links:connectors},
and discuss their functionality/implementation in other chapters.

The instance procedure
\fcnref{\proc[]{duplex-link}}{../ns-2/ns-link.tcl}{Simulator::duplex-link}
constructs a bi-directional link from two simplex links.

\section{Instance Procedures for Links and SimpleLinks}
\label{sec:links:components}

\paragraph{Link procedures}
The \clsref{Link}{../ns-2/ns-link.tcl} is implemented entirely in Otcl.
The OTcl {\tt SimpleLink} class uses the C++ {\tt LinkDelay} class
to simulate packet delivery delays.
The instance procedures in the class Link are:

\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{rX}
\fcnref{\proc[]{head}}{../ns-2/ns-link.tcl}{Link::head} &
		returns the handle for {\tt head\\_}. \\
\fcnref{\proc[]{queue}}{../ns-2/ns-link.tcl}{Link::queue} &
		returns the handle for {\tt queue\\_}. \\
\fcnref{\proc[]{link}}{../ns-2/ns-link.tcl}{Link::link} &
		returns the handle for the delay element, {\tt link\\_}. \\
\fcnref{\proc[]{up}}{../ns-2/ns-link.tcl}{Link::up} &
		set link status to ``up'' in the {\tt dynamics\\_} element.
		Also, writes out a trace line to each file specified through
		the procedure \proc[]{trace-dynamics}.\\
\fcnref{\proc[]{down}}{../ns-2/ns-link.tcl}{Link::down} &
		As with \proc[]{up},
		set link status to ``down'' in the {\tt dynamics\\_} element.
		Also, writes out a trace line to each file specified through
		the procedure \proc[]{trace-dynamics}.\\
\fcnref{\proc[]{up?}}{../ns-2/ns-link.tcl}{Link::up?} &
		returns status of the link.   Status is ``up'' or ``down'';
		status is ``up'' if link dynamics is not enabled.\\
\fcnref{\proc[]{all-connectors}}{../ns-2/ns-link.tcl}{Link::all-connectors} &
		Apply specified operation to all connectors on the link.p
		An example of such usage is {\tt link all-connectors reset}.\\
\fcnref{\proc[]{cost}}{../ns-2/ns-link.tcl}{Link::cost} &
		set link cost to value specified.\\
\fcnref{\proc[]{cost?}}{../ns-2/ns-link.tcl}{Link::cost?} &
		returns the cost of the link.  Default cost of link is 1, 
		if no cost has been specified earlier.\\
\end{tabularx}

\paragraph{SimpleLink Procedures}
The Otcl \clsref{SimpleLink}{../ns-2/ns-link.tcl}
implements a simple point-to-point
link with an associated queue and delay\footnote{The current
version also includes an object to examine the
network layer ``ttl'' field and discard packets if the
field reaches zero.}.
It is derived from the base Otcl class Link as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
        Class SimpleLink -superclass Link
        SimpleLink instproc init { src dst bw delay q { lltype "DelayLink" } } {
                \$self next \$src \$dst
                \$self instvar link\_ queue\_ head\_ toNode\_ ttl\_
                ...
                set queue\_ \$q
                set link\_ [new Delay/Link]
                \$link\_ set bandwidth\_ \$bw
                \$link\_ set delay\_ \$delay

                \$queue\_ target \$link\_
                \$link\_ target [\$toNode\_ entry]

                ...
                # XXX
                # put the ttl checker after the delay
                # so we don't have to worry about accounting
                # for ttl-drops within the trace and/or monitor
                # fabric
                #
                set ttl\_ [new TTLChecker]
                \$ttl\_ target [\$link\_ target]
                \$link\_ target \$ttl\_
        }
\end{verbatim}
Notice that when a {\tt SimpleLink} object is created,
new {\tt Delay/Link} and {\tt TTLChecker} objects are
also created.
Note also that,
the {\tt Queue} object must have already been created.

There are two additional methods implemented (in OTcl) as part
of the {\tt SimpleLink} class: {\tt trace} and {\tt init-monitor}.
These functions are described in further detail
\href{in the section on tracing}{Chapter}{chap:trace}. 

\section{Connectors}
\label{sec:links:connectors}

Connectors, unlink  classifiers, only generate data for one recipient;
either the packet is delivered to the {\tt target\_} neighbor, or it
is sent to he {\tt drop-target\_}.

A connector will receive a packet, perform some function,
and deliver the packet to its neighbor, or drop the packet.
There are a number of different types of connectors in \emph{ns}.
Each connector performs a different function.

\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{rX}
networkinterface & labels packets with incoming interface identifier---it 
			is used by some multicast routing protocols.
			The class variable ``Simulator NumberInterfaces\_ 1''
			tells \emph{ns}\ to add these interfaces, and then, it is
			added to either end of the simplex link.
			\href{Multicast routing protocols are discussed in
				a separate chapter}{Chapter}{chap:multicast}.\\
DynaLink &	Object that gates traffic depending on whether the link 
		is up or down.  It expects to be at the head of the link,
		and is inserted on the link just prior to simulation start.
		It's {\tt status\\_} variable control whether the link is
		up or down.
		\href{The description of how the DynaLink object is used
		is in a separate chapter}{Chapter}{chap:net-dynamics}.\\
DelayLink &	Object that models the link's
		delay and bandwidth characteristics.
		If the link is not dynamic, then this object simply
		schedules receive events for the downstream object
		for each packet it receives at the appropriate time
		for that packet.  However, if the link is dynamic,
		then it queues the packets internally, and schedules
		one receives event for itself for the next packet that must
		be delivered.
		Thus, if the link goes down at some point, this object's
	 \fcnref{\fcn[]{reset} method}{../ns-2/delay.cc}{DelayLink::reset}
		is invoked, and the object will drop all packets in transit
		at the instant of link failure.
		We discuss the
		\href{specifics of this class in another chapter}{Chapter}{%
			chap:delays}.\\
Queues &	model the output buffers attached
		to a link in a ``real'' router in a network.
		In \emph{ns}, they are attached to, and 
		are considered as part of the link.
		We discuss the
		\href{details of queues and different types of queues in \emph{ns}
			in another chapter}{Chapter}{chap:qmgmt}.\\
TTLChecker &	will decrement the ttl in each packet that it receives.
		If that ttl then has a positive value, the packet is forwarded
		to the next element on the link.  In the simple links,
		TTLCheckers are automatically added, and are placed
		as the last element on the link, between the delay element,
		and the entry for the next node.\\
\end{tabularx}


\section{Object hierarchy}
\label{sec:linkobjects}

The base class used to represent links is called Link. Methods for
this class are listed in the next section. Other link objects derived from
the base class are given as follows:

\begin{itemize}

\item SimpleLink Object
A SimpleLink object is used to represent a simple unidirectional link.
There are no state variables or configuration parameters associated with
this object. Methods for this class are:
{\tt \$simplelink enable-mcast \<src\> \<dst\>}\\
This turns on multicast for the link by creating an incoming network
interface for the destination and adds an outgoing interface for the
source.

{\tt \$simplelink trace \<ns\> \<file\> \<optional:op\>}\\
Build trace objects for this link and update object linkage. If op is
specified as "nam" create nam trace files.

{\tt \$simplelink nam-trace \<ns\> \<file\>}\\
Sets up nam tracing in the link.

{\tt \$simplelink trace-dynamics \<ns\> \<file\> \<optional:op\>}\\
This sets up tracing specially for dynamic links. <op> allows setting up
of nam tracing as well.

{\tt \$simplelink init-monitor \<ns\> \<qtrace\> \<sampleInterval\>}\\
Insert objects that allow us to monitor the queue size of this link.
Return the name of the object that can be queried to determine the average
queue size.

{\tt \$simplelink attach-monitors \<insnoop\> \<outsnoop\> \<dropsnoop\> \<qmon\>}\\
This is similar to init-monitor, but allows for specification of more of
the items.

{\tt \$simplelink dynamic}\\
Sets up the dynamic flag for this link.

{\tt \$simplelink errormodule \<args\>}\\
Inserts an error module before the queue.

{\tt \$simpleilnk insert-linkloss \<args\>}\\
Inserts the error module after the queue.

//Other link objects derived from class SimpleLink are FQLink,
CBQLink and IntServLink.

Configuration parameters for FQLink are:
\begin{description}
\item[queueManagement\_] The type of queue management used in the link.
                        Default value is DropTail.
\end{description}

No configuration parameters are specified for CBQLink and IntServLink
objects.


\item DelayLink Object
The DelayLink Objects determine the amount of time required for a packet
to traverse a link. This is defined to be size/bw + delay where size is
the packet size, bw is the link bandwidth and delay is the link
propagation delay. There are no methods or state variables associated with
this object. 

Configuration Parameters are:
\begin{description}

\item[bandwidth\_] Link bandwidth in bits per second. 

\item[delay\_] Link propagation delay in seconds. 
\end{description}
\end{itemize}

\section{Commands at a glance}
\label{sec:linkscommand}

Following is a list of common link commands used in simulation scripts:
\begin{flushleft}

{\tt \$ns\_ simplex-link \<node1\> \<node2\> \<bw\> \<delay\> \<qtype\> \<args\>}\\
This command creates an unidirectional link between node1 and node2 with
specified bandwidth (BW) and delay characteristics. The link uses a queue
type of <qtype> and depending on the queue type different arguments are
passed through <args>.


{\tt \$ns\_ duplex-link \<node1\> \<node2\> \<bw\> \<delay\> \<qtype\> \<args\>}\\
This creates a bi-directional link between node1 and node2. This procedure
essentially creates a duplex-link from two simplex links, one from node1
to node2 and the other from node2 to node1. The syntax for duplex-link is
same as that of simplex-link described above.


{\tt \$ns\_ duplex-intserv-link \<n1\> \<n2\> \<bw\> \<dly\> \<sched\> \<signal\> \<adc\> \<args\>}\\
This creates a duplex-link between n1 and n2 with queue type of intserv, with
specified BW and delay. This type of queue implements a scheduler with two
level services priority. The type of intserv queue is given by <sched>, with
admission control unit type of <adc> and signal module of type <signal>.


{\tt \$ns\_ simplex-link-op \<n1\> \<n2\> \<op\> \<args\>}\\
This is used to set attributes for a simplex link. The attributes may be
the orientation, color, label, or queue-position.


{\tt \$ns\_ duplex-link-op \<n1\> \<n2\> \<op\> \<args\>}\\
This command is used to set link attributes (like orientation of the links,
color, label, or queue-position) for duplex links.


{\tt \$ns\_ link-lossmodel \<lossobj\> \<from\> \<to\>}\\
This function generates losses (using the loss model <lossobj> inserted in
the link between <from> node and <to> node) in the link that can be
visualized by nam.


{\tt \$ns\_ lossmodel \<lossobj\> \<from\> \<to\>}\\
This is used to insert a loss module in regular links.



Following is a list of internal link-related procedures:

{\tt \$ns\_ register-nam-linkconfig \<link\>}\\
This is an internal procedure used by {\tt "\$link orient"} to 
register/update the order in which links should be created in nam.


{\tt \$ns\_ remove-nam-linkconfig \<id1\> \<id2\>}\\
This procedure is used to remove any duplicate links (duplicate links may be
created by GT-ITM topology generator).


{\tt \$link head}\\
Returns the instance variable {\tt head\_} for the link. The {\tt head\_} is
the entry pont to the link and it points to the first object in the link.


{\tt \$link add-to-head \<connector\>}\\
This allows the <connector> object to be now pointed by the {\tt head\_}
element in the link, i.e, <connector> now becomes the first object in the
link.


{\tt \$link link}\\
Returns the instance variable {\tt link\_}. The {\tt link\_} is the element
in the link that actually models the link in terms of delay and bandwidth
characteristics of the link.


{\tt \$link queue}\\
Returns the instance variable {\tt queue\_}. {\tt queue\_} is queue element
in the link. There may be one or more queue elements in a particular link.


{\tt \$link cost \<c\>}\\
This sets a link cost of <c>.


{\tt \$link cost?}\\
Returns the cost value for the link. Default cost of link is set to 1.


{\tt \$link if-label?}\\
Returns the network interfaces associated with the link (for multicast routing).


{\tt \$link up}\\
This sets the link status to "up". This command is a part of network
dynamics support in \emph{ns}.


{\tt \$link down}\\
Similar to up, this command marks the link status as "down".


{\tt \$link up?}\\
Returns the link status. The status is always "up" as default, if link
dynamics is not enabled.


{\tt \$link all-connectors op}\\ 
This command applies the specified operation <op> to all connectors in the
link.  Like, {\tt \$link all-connectors reset} or
{\tt \$link all-connectors isDynamic}. 


{\tt \$link install-error \<errmodel\>}\\
This installs an error module after the {\tt link\_} element.


In addition to the Link and link-related commands listed above, there are
other procedures to support the specific requirements of different types of
links derived from the base class "Link" like simple-link (SimpleLink),
integrated service (IntServLink), class-based queue (CBQLink), fair queue
(FQLink) and procedures to support multicast routing, sessionsim, nam etc.
These and the above procedures may be found in \emph{ns}/tcl/lib(ns-lib.tcl,
ns-link.tcl, ns-intserv.tcl, ns-namsupp.tcl, ns-queue.tcl),
\emph{ns}/tcl/mcast/(McastMonitor.tcl, ns-mcast.tcl), 
\emph{ns}/tcl/session/session.tcl.

\end{flushleft}
