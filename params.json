This module is a free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Public License Version 1 or (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\n### Introduction\r\nNs is a discrete event simulator targeted at networking research. Ns provides substantial support for simulation of TCP, routing, and multicast protocols over wired and wireless (local and satellite) networks [Text from ns-2 official page]. This project implements a RFID module based on the EPCTM Radio-Frequency Identity Protocols Class-1 Generation-2 UHF RFID Protocol for Communications at 860 MHz ? 960 MHz Version 1.2.0(25/10/2008)standard for the ns-2 simulator, release 2.35. The focus of this implementation is the Network layer and its mechanisms for anti-collision.\r\n\r\n### Comparison\r\n\r\nResults obtained in a simulation with the module were compared with the simulation results presented in the paper:\r\nNamboodiri, Vinod, et al. \"An extensive study of slotted Aloha-based RFID anti-collision protocols.\" Computer Communications (2012), Volume 35, Issue 36, 15 September 2012, pages 1955--1966.\r\nand can be shown bellow*\r\nThe paper values are not exact. Until now the authors did not provide the table that generated the curve. The points were estimated by linear interpolation assuming that the points bellow are correct. (50,160) and (500,1500) \r\n![](https://www.ime.usp.br/~perazzo/identification.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nTo install the module, follow the instructions below: \r\nDownload the software ns-allinone-2.35 package. Unzip the ns-2 RFID module source code file inside ns-allinone-2.35 folder. Go to the ns-allinone-2.35/ns-2.35 directory and execute \"./configure\", \"make clean\" and \"make\". If you have root privileges execute \"make install\". \r\nBellow you will find a video showing the installation of the module http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2w6deoJTJg&feature=c4-overview&list=UUQhWGzqo8pIKY1Jc0U9v3Rw\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
